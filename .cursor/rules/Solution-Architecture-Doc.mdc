## Solution Architecture Document Rule

- Ensure `documentation/Solution_Architecture.md` exists; if missing, create it with an introductory header and table of contents.
- After any architecture-affecting change (new component/service, library upgrade, infrastructure update), prompt to append a new entry that includes:
  1. **Date & Title** of the change
  2. **Decision:** what was decided
  3. **Rationale:** why this approach was chosen
  4. **Alternatives:** other options considered with trade‑offs
- During PR reviews for changes spanning multiple domains (frontend, backend, infra), remind to update the architecture document.
- Use the following stub when prompting:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] – <Change Title>
- **Decision:** <Description of the decision>
- **Rationale:** <Reasoning behind the choice>
- **Alternatives:** <List other options and trade‑offs>
```
