# Day 9: Goals Feature – Frontend & Charts

## Summary of Tasks
- Build `GoalsList`, `GoalCreateEdit`, and `GoalDetail` React components.
- Integrate React Query and Axios for data fetching from `/goals` API.
- Add a Recharts progress chart on the detail page to visualize goal progress.
- Write React Testing Library tests for components and chart rendering.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to view a list of my fitness goals so I can track them at a glance.
- As a user, I want to create and edit goals through a validated form so my data is accurate.
- As a user, I want to see detailed information and progress charts for each goal.
- As a developer, I want typed React components and API hooks to minimize runtime errors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `GoalsList` fetches GET `/goals` and displays each goal's `title` and `targetDate`.
- `GoalCreateEdit` presents a form (using Formik or React Hook Form) to POST or PUT `/goals` with validation (required fields, date).  
- `GoalDetail` fetches GET `/goals/:id`, displays all fields, and renders a Recharts line or area chart showing progress mock data.
- React Query is configured for caching and invalidation after create/update/delete.
- Component tests cover rendering, user interactions, and chart data presence.

## IDE Testing Criteria
1. Run `npm test` → all React tests pass.
2. Manually in browser:
   - Navigate to `/goals` → list displays existing goals.
   - Click "New Goal" → `/goals/new` → form validation triggers.
   - Submit form → new goal appears in list.
   - Click a goal → `/goals/:id` → detail and chart visible.

## Vibe‑Coding Prompts
1. **Planning Prompt:**
   "Tell me your plan first; don't code. Outline micro‑steps to build the `GoalsList`, `GoalCreateEdit`, and `GoalDetail` components with chart integration."  
2. **GoalsList Component:**
   "Implement the simplest next step: create `GoalsList.tsx` that fetches `/goals` and renders a list."  
3. **Create/Edit Form:**
   "Break down tasks to add `GoalCreateEdit.tsx` with Formik (or React Hook Form) and validation; confirm then code."  
4. **Detail & Recharts:**
   "Describe steps to fetch goal by ID and render a Recharts chart in `GoalDetail.tsx`; after approval, generate code."  
5. **Component Tests:**
   "List sub‑tasks to write React Testing Library tests for these components; plan first, then write test files."

## Current Status

### User Story Status
- ✅ **View Fitness Goals**: COMPLETED - Implemented `GoalList.tsx` with filtering and pagination
- ✅ **Create/Edit Goals**: COMPLETED - Implemented `GoalForm.tsx` with validation and error handling
- ✅ **View Goal Details**: COMPLETED - Implemented `GoalDetail.tsx` with progress visualization
- ✅ **Type Safety**: COMPLETED - All components, hooks, and services use TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ **Development Setup**: COMPLETED - Added robust local development setup with emulators

### Completed Tasks
1. **Core Components Implementation**:
   - ✅ `GoalList.tsx` - List component with filtering (all/active/achieved) and pagination
   - ✅ `GoalForm.tsx` - Create/edit form with validation and submission handling
   - ✅ `GoalDetail.tsx` - Detail view with progress visualization and edit/back functionality
   - ✅ `GoalsPagination.tsx` - Reusable pagination component with configurable items per page
   - ✅ `GoalRoutes.tsx` - Route configuration for all goal-related views

2. **Data Management**:
   - ✅ `goalService.ts` - Service layer with mock data support for development
   - ✅ `useGoals.ts` - Custom React Query hooks for all CRUD operations
   - ✅ Implemented optimistic updates for mutations
   - ✅ Added proper caching and invalidation strategies
   - ✅ Fixed TypeScript interface for `updatedAt` field to ensure type safety

3. **UI/UX Features**:
   - ✅ Progress visualization with linear and circular progress indicators
   - ✅ Filter controls for goal status (all/active/achieved)
   - ✅ Pagination with configurable items per page
   - ✅ Responsive layouts for all screen sizes
   - ✅ Loading and error states handled throughout

4. **TypeScript Integration**:
   - ✅ Defined interfaces for all data models
   - ✅ Type-safe hooks and components
   - ✅ Proper typing for React Query operations

5. **Development Environment Setup**:
   - ✅ Created `scripts/start-dev.ps1` for one-click development setup
   - ✅ Improved database configuration to gracefully handle emulator unavailability
   - ✅ Added support for mock data fallback when emulators aren't available
   - ✅ Fixed port conflict issues with `kill-services` scripts
   - ✅ Added proper error handling for API requests
   - ✅ Created example HTTP requests file for testing

### Issues and Pending Items
1. **Development Environment**:
   - ✅ Azure Cosmos DB Emulator connection issues - RESOLVED with installation script and better fallback
   - ✅ PORT conflicts with backend service - RESOLVED with proper kill-port scripts
   - ⚠️ Self-signed certificate warnings from the emulator - Not critical for development

2. **Testing**:
   - 🔄 E2E tests implementation in progress for Cypress
   - 🔄 Unit tests for React components need completion

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - 🔄 Bundle size optimization pending
   - 🔄 Lazy loading for chart components recommended

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Fix Cosmos DB Emulator connection issues for local development - COMPLETED
2. ✅ Fix PORT conflicts with proper scripts - COMPLETED
3. Complete unit tests for React components 
4. Implement E2E tests with Cypress
5. Optimize bundle size and performance
6. Add option to ignore self-signed certificate warnings in development
7. Improve API error handling for better user experience
8. Implement server-side pagination for goals list when user has many goals
