# Day 7: Navigation Dashboard Shell

## Summary of Tasks
- Create centralized route config in `routes.tsx`: standardizes navigation.
- Build `NavBar` component with drawer & mobile version: ensures responsive design.
- Implement protected routes with auth guards: redirects unauthenticated users.
- Create dashboard shell with placeholder widgets: sets up UI structure.
- Implement toast notification service: provides user feedback throughout the app.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want a persistent navigation menu for easy access to all sections.
- As a user, I want a responsive UI that adapts to my device's screen size.
- As a developer, I want a centralized route config to simplify adding new pages.
- As a user, I want feedback through toast notifications for actions and system events.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Centralized `routes.tsx` with typed `RouteConfig` interface defines all app routes.
- Material UI drawer acts as primary navigation on desktop.
- Bottom navigation bar appears on mobile devices (breakpoint: `md`).
- `/dashboard` and `/profile` routes are protected from unauthenticated access.
- Dashboard UI has responsive grid layout with placeholder widget components.
- Toast notification service provides success, error, warning, and info messages.

## IDE Testing Criteria
1. Check TypeScript compilation:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```
   - No type errors in route config, navigation, or dashboard components.
2. Run Cypress end-to-end tests:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run cy:run
   ```
   - Navigation flow test passes, confirming routes work correctly.
   - Authentication flow test passes, confirming protected routes redirect properly.
3. Verify responsive design:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   # In Chrome DevTools:
   # 1. Toggle device toolbar (mobile view)
   # 2. Resize to test various breakpoints
   ```
   - Navigation transforms from drawer to bottom bar at `md` breakpoint.
   - Dashboard layout reflows for smaller screens.
4. Test toast notification service:
   ```bash
   # In the browser after npm start:
   # Open console and enter:
   window.testToast('success', 'Test success message')
   window.testToast('error', 'Test error message')
   ```
   - Toast notifications appear in the designated position with correct styling.

## Vibe‑Coding Prompts
1. **Planning Prompt:**
   "Tell me your plan first; don't code. Outline micro‑steps to implement centralized route config, responsive navigation, and protected routes."
2. **Routes Configuration:**
   "Describe how to build a typed route configuration in `routes.tsx`; confirm approach before generating code."
3. **Navigation Component:**
   "Break down creating a responsive `NavBar` with drawer and bottom navigation; plan first, then implement."
4. **Protected Routes:**
   "List steps to implement auth protection with redirects; after approval, generate the component code."
5. **Dashboard Shell:**
   "Sketch the dashboard layout with placeholder widgets; confirm then implement the component."
6. **Toast Service:**
   "Outline the implementation of a toast notification service using react-hot-toast; after approval, create the service module."

## Implementation Notes
- The navigation system is designed to be responsive to different screen sizes:
  - On desktop: Left sidebar drawer with all navigation options
  - On mobile: Bottom navigation bar with key routes
- The route configuration system uses TypeScript interfaces to enforce type safety
- Protected routes implement a redirect mechanism to the login page for unauthenticated users
- Toast notifications use react-hot-toast with customized styling to match the application theme

## Current Status

### Completed Tasks

- **Centralized Route Configuration**:
  - ✅ Created `RouteConfig` TypeScript interface with all required properties

  - ✅ Highlighted active route in navigation UI
  - ✅ Added keyboard navigation support

- **Protected Routes**:
  - ✅ Implemented `ProtectedRoute` component to guard authenticated routes
  - ✅ Added redirect logic to send unauthenticated users to login
  - ✅ Created RequireAuth component for conditional rendering
  - ✅ Added AuthProvider wrapper in App component
  - ✅ Implemented seamless integration with authContext

- **Dashboard Shell**:
  - ✅ Created responsive grid layout for dashboard widgets

  - ✅ Added high contrast mode support

### Next Steps

1. **Goals Feature Implementation**:
   - Implement fitness goals data model in the backend
   - Create CRUD API endpoints for goals
   - Design goals UI components for the frontend
   - Implement goal progress tracking

2. **Profile Features**:
   - Implement user profile UI components
   - Create forms for editing user information
   - Add profile picture upload capability
   - Connect profile UI to backend API

3. **Dashboard Widgets**:
   - Design and implement real-time data widgets
   - Create charts and statistics displays
   - Add configurable widget layout

4. **Testing Coverage**:
   - Expand unit tests for all new components
   - Add more comprehensive E2E tests with Cypress
   - Test responsive behavior across devices

## Recommendations for Optimization
- Consider implementing route-based code splitting to reduce initial bundle size
- Add lazy loading for non-critical components to improve performance
- Consider implementing a state management solution like Redux or Zustand for more complex state
- Add more comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
