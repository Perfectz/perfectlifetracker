# Day 13: Analytics & AI Insights – UI & Dashboard

## Summary of Tasks
- Create `InsightsCard` React component to display analytics metrics and AI summary.
- Develop custom hooks (`useAnalytics` and `useFitnessSummary`) to fetch from `/analytics/fitness` and `/openai/fitness-summary`.
- Integrate `InsightsCard` into the `/dashboard` route.
- Style the card using Material UI `Card` and theme tokens.
- Write component tests and an integration test for the dashboard view.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to see my weekly workout statistics on the dashboard so I can quickly gauge performance.
- As a user, I want a natural-language summary generated by AI so I can understand my trends at a glance.
- As a developer, I want reusable hooks for analytics data to standardize API interactions.
- As a stakeholder, I want a consistent dashboard card design matching the app theme.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `InsightsCard` renders:
  - Numeric metrics (`totalDuration`, `totalCalories`, `averageDurationPerDay`, `averageCaloriesPerDay`).
  - A text summary from OpenAI.
- Custom hooks:
  - `useAnalytics(startDate, endDate)` returns typed analytics data and loading/error states.
  - `useFitnessSummary(startDate, endDate)` returns `{ summary: string }` and loading/error.
- `/dashboard` page imports and displays `InsightsCard` with correct props (dates).
- Material UI styling applied: responsive card layout, theme-aware colors.
- React Testing Library tests cover:
  - Hook behavior (mock API responses).
  - `InsightsCard` rendering of metrics and summary.
  - Dashboard integration: card appears and populates data.

## IDE Testing Criteria
1. Unit tests:
   - Run `npm test` → all tests for hooks and `InsightsCard` pass.
2. Manual in browser:
   - Navigate to `/dashboard` → `InsightsCard` displays numeric metrics and summary text.
   - Verify loading and error states by mocking network failures.
3. TypeScript check:
   - `tsc --noEmit` → no type errors in hooks or component files.

## Vibe‑Coding Prompts
1. **Planning Prompt:**
   "Tell me your plan first; don't code. Outline micro‑steps to build `useAnalytics` and `useFitnessSummary` hooks, `InsightsCard` component, dashboard integration, styling, and tests."
2. **Hooks Implementation:**
   "Describe tasks to write `useAnalytics` and `useFitnessSummary` hooks with React Query; after confirmation, generate the hook code."
3. **InsightsCard Component:**
   "Break down creating `InsightsCard.tsx` to render metrics and summary; plan first, then implement the component."
4. **Dashboard Integration:**
   "List micro‑steps to import and render `InsightsCard` in `Dashboard.tsx`; await my approval before coding."
5. **Styling & Tests:**
   "Outline steps to style the card with MUI and write React Testing Library tests; show plan, then write style and test files."
