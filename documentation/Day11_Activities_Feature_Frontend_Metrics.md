# Day 11: Activities Feature â€“ Frontend & Metrics

## Summary of Tasks
- Build `ActivityForm` component to log new activities with validation.
- Create `ActivityList` with date and type filters to browse history.
- Implement `MetricsSummary` component to calculate total duration, total calories, and average per day.
- Integrate React Query/Axios hooks for `/activities` API calls.
- Write React Testing Library tests for forms, lists, and metrics.

## Implementation Status
### âœ… Completed Tasks
- Built `ActivityForm` component with validation and submit handlers
- Created `ActivityList` component with filtering, pagination, and delete functionality
- Implemented `MetricsSummary` with stats calculation and visual rendering
- Integrated React Query hooks for data fetching and mutations
- Added tests for all three components

### ðŸ”„ Improvements Made
1. **Activity Form**:
   - Fixed validation with default values (calories set to 1 instead of 0)
   - Added Cancel button for edit mode to improve UX
   - Fixed unused variable warnings

2. **Activity List**:
   - Extracted filter controls into a separate component for better code organization
   - Replaced window.confirm with accessible MUI Dialog for deletion confirmation
   - Improved state management with proper typing

3. **Metrics Summary**:
   - Created reusable StatCard component to reduce redundant code
   - Added decimal precision to average duration for better accuracy
   - Fixed JSX comment format to prevent them from rendering on the page
   - **NEW** Added accessibility improvements with aria-labels for screen readers
   - **NEW** Wrapped icon elements with aria-hidden for decorative icons
   - **NEW** Fixed type consistency by converting string to number for avgDurationPerDay
   - **NEW** Added React key props to avoid reconciliation warnings
   - **NEW** Updated aria attributes for better screen reader announcements

4. **React Query Hooks**:
   - Updated placeholderData usage in useActivities hook
   - Added proper typing for filter state

5. **Tests**:
   - Updated tests to match component changes
   - Added tests for StatCard rendering and tooltip functionality
   - Fixed delete dialog confirmation test
   - **NEW** Created comprehensive test suite for MetricsSummary component:
     - Loading state testing
     - Empty state rendering verification
     - Accurate metrics calculations for multiple activities
     - Time formatting display (hours, minutes) for durations over 60 minutes
     - Single activity handling
     - More robust selectors using role-based queries
     - Handling potential duplicate text elements

### ðŸ§ª Test Results
All components pass unit tests with only expected warnings regarding any types in other parts of the codebase.

**NEW** MetricsSummary.tsx has 100% code coverage for statements, functions, and lines, with 89.47% branch coverage.

## Next Steps
- Consider adding i18n support for better localization
- Optimize filter state with debounce to reduce API calls
- Extract navigation side-effects from React Query hooks
- Complete remaining code coverage for conditional branches in MetricsSummary
- Consider performance optimizations for larger activity datasets
- Review focus management for enhanced keyboard navigation

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to log an activity so I can track my workouts.
- As a user, I want to filter my activities by date and type so I can find specific entries.
- As a user, I want to see key metrics (total time, calories burned) so I can assess my performance.
- As a developer, I want typed React hooks and components to catch errors at compile time.
- **NEW** As a user with accessibility needs, I want to use the application with a screen reader.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `ActivityForm` uses Formik or React Hook Form, validates required fields (`type`, `duration`, `date`), and submits to POST `/activities`.
- `ActivityList` fetches GET `/activities` and displays entries; supports filters via query params.
- `MetricsSummary` computes and displays:
  - Total duration (in minutes)
  - Total calories burned
  - Average duration per day
- React Query is used for caching and invalidation after form submission or deletion.
- Component tests cover:
  - Form validation and submission
  - List rendering and filter interactions
  - Metrics calculations based on mock data
- **NEW** Components should be accessible with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.

## IDE Testing Criteria
1. Run `npm test` â†’ all React tests for activities pass.
2. Manual in browser:
   - Navigate to `/activities` â†’ list and metrics display existing data.
   - Use filters â†’ list updates correctly.
   - Submit new activity via `ActivityForm` â†’ list and metrics refresh.
3. TypeScript check: `tsc --noEmit` â†’ no errors in component or hook files.
4. **NEW** Test with screen reader: MetricsSummary component properly announces all metrics.

## Vibeâ€‘Coding Prompts
1. **Planning Prompt:**
   "Tell me your plan first; don't code. Outline microâ€‘steps to build `ActivityForm`, `ActivityList`, `MetricsSummary`, and React Query integration for activities."
2. **ActivityForm Component:**
   "Implement the simplest next step: create `ActivityForm.tsx` with form fields for `type`, `duration`, `date`, and submit handler."  
3. **ActivityList with Filters:**
   "Describe tasks to build `ActivityList.tsx` with GET `/activities` and UI filters; confirm then code the component."
4. **MetricsSummary Implementation:**
   "List subâ€‘tasks to compute and render total duration, calories, and average per day in `MetricsSummary.tsx`; after approval, generate code."
5. **Component Tests:**
   "Break down writing React Testing Library tests for `ActivityForm`, `ActivityList`, and `MetricsSummary`; show me the plan, then write test files."
6. **Accessibility Improvements:**
   "Review the MetricsSummary component for accessibility issues and outline improvements for screen reader compatibility."
