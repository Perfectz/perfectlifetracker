# Day 1: Repo & Infra Scaffold

## Summary of Tasks
- Scaffold monorepo structure (`/frontend` + `/backend`): provides a unified workspace for full‑stack development.
- Configure ESLint & Prettier in both projects: enforces consistent code style and prevents formatting debates.
- Initialize Terraform stub under `/infra`: codifies future infrastructure planning.
- Add CI pipeline stub (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): ensures automated linting and builds on each push.

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want a monorepo so I can work on frontend and backend together.
- As a team member, I want ESLint and Prettier configured so code style issues are caught early.
- As a DevOps engineer, I want a Terraform placeholder so infrastructure can be defined as code later.
- As a stakeholder, I want a CI pipeline stub so basic checks run automatically on pull requests.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `/frontend` and `/backend` directories exist with initialized TypeScript projects.
- Each project contains `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.eslintrc.js`, and `.prettierrc`.
- `/frontend/webpack.config.js` exists with TypeScript support.
- `/infra/main.tf` defines at least one Azure resource group block as a placeholder.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is present and configured to run checkout → install → lint.

## IDE Testing Criteria
- In `/frontend` and `/backend`:
  1. Run `npm install` → no errors.
  2. Run `npm run lint` → passes without warnings.
- In `/infra`:
  1. Run `terraform init` → remote/stub backend configured.
  2. Run `terraform validate` → configuration is valid.
- Create a test branch, push to remote, and verify that GitHub Actions stub triggers without failures.

## Implementation Status
| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Scaffold monorepo structure | ✅ Completed | Created `/frontend` and `/backend` directories with proper TypeScript project structure |
| Configure ESLint & Prettier | ✅ Completed | Added `.eslintrc.js` and `.prettierrc` with sensible defaults to both frontend and backend |
| Set up webpack for frontend | ✅ Completed | Added webpack.config.js with TypeScript, CSS, and asset support |
| Initialize Terraform stub | ✅ Completed | Created `main.tf` with Azure resource group placeholder |
| Add CI pipeline stub | ✅ Completed | Added GitHub Actions workflow for linting and Terraform validation |

**Implementation Notes:**
- All tasks from Day 1 have been successfully implemented and verified against the acceptance criteria
- Frontend project configured with React 18, TypeScript, MUI components, and necessary build tooling
- Backend project configured with Express, TypeScript, and middleware setup
- Terraform validation confirms resource group configuration is valid
- Project structure follows best practices for a modern TypeScript monorepo

**Technical Highlights:**
- Proper separation of dev vs. production dependencies
- Comprehensive ESLint rules to enforce code quality
- Terraform set up to support later expansion with parameterized resources
- CI pipeline configured for both JavaScript/TypeScript and Terraform validation

**Implementation Credits:**
- Implementation completed by Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- Verified by ChatGPT-4
- All acceptance criteria validated through file inspection and Terraform validation

## Vibe‑Coding Prompts
1. **Planning Prompt:**
   "Tell me your plan first; don't code. Outline a README spec that covers monorepo structure, tech stack, and up to 5 scaffold milestones."
2. **Monorepo Scaffold:**
   "Implement the simplest next step: scaffold `/frontend` and `/backend` as TypeScript projects with minimal `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`."
3. **Lint & Format Setup:**
   "Describe micro‑steps to configure ESLint and Prettier in both projects; after I confirm, generate `.eslintrc.js` and `.prettierrc`."
4. **Terraform Stub:**
   "Draft a Terraform `main.tf` that creates an Azure resource group placeholder; show me the plan before code."
5. **CI Pipeline Stub:**
   "Break CI pipeline creation into steps: setup checkout, install dependencies, and lint jobs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; await my confirmation before writing YAML."
