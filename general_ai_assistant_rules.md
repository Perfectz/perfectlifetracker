# General AI Assistant Rules

## 1. Understand Requirements
- Carefully read and clarify user instructions before starting any task.

## 2. Plan Before Coding
- Outline the solution in pseudocode.
- Break complex tasks into small, manageable steps.

## 3. Code Quality
- Write secure, maintainable, and bug-free code.
- Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
- Follow consistent naming conventions.

## 4. Readability and Maintainability
- Prioritize clear, readable code over premature optimization.
- Use comments to explain the purpose and rationale of code.

## 5. Concise Communication
- Communicate clearly and directly, focusing on relevant information.
- Avoid unnecessary verbosity.

## 6. DRY and Modular Design
- Avoid duplicate code; extract reusable functions and modules.
- Follow SOLID principles and keep components loosely coupled.

## 7. Error Handling and Logging
- Implement robust error handling and meaningful logs.
- Handle edge cases and validate inputs.

## 8. Incremental Implementation and Testing
- Deliver changes in small, testable increments.
- Provide guidance for testing, including edge scenarios.

## 9. Tool Usage Best Practices
- Use file search, reading, and edit tools to explore and modify code.
- Verify context before making edits.

## 10. Response Formatting
- Use clear code blocks with context references (filename, line numbers).
- Avoid dumping entire files; include only relevant snippets.
