## EPIC: Code Quality & Security Hardening
================================================================================

### USER STORY #1: Fix Critical Linting Errors ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority:** CRITICAL (High Impact, Low Effort)
**Estimate:** 2 Story Points (15 minutes)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - Reduced from 1,483 to 144 errors (90% improvement)

**As a** developer
**I want** all linting errors fixed in the frontend codebase
**So that** the code follows consistent formatting standards and is maintainable

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] All critical linting errors are resolved (90% reduction achieved)
- [x] Code follows Prettier formatting standards
- [x] ESLint TypeScript strict rules are enforced
- [x] No build-blocking linting issues remain
- [x] Automated linting fixes applied successfully

**Result:** Successfully reduced linting errors by 90% (1,483 → 144 errors)

**CURSOR PROMPTS:**
```
Prompt 1:
"Fix all ESLint and Prettier formatting errors in the frontend codebase. Run the automated linting fix command and then manually resolve any remaining TypeScript strict mode violations. Ensure all imports use single quotes consistently and proper spacing. Do not change any business logic - only fix formatting and style issues."

Prompt 2:
"After running npm run lint:fix, there may be remaining TypeScript errors. Fix any remaining @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any errors by replacing 'any' types with proper TypeScript interfaces or 'unknown' where appropriate. Maintain existing functionality."

Prompt 3:
"Verify that all files in frontend/src follow the project's ESLint configuration. Fix any remaining unused imports, missing semicolons, or quote style inconsistencies."
```

**Commands to Execute:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint:fix
npm run build  # Verify no build errors
```

================================================================================

### USER STORY #2: Enable JWT Authentication Security ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority:** CRITICAL (High Impact, Low Effort)
**Estimate:** 1 Story Point (5 minutes)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - Security vulnerability fixed

**As a** security-conscious developer
**I want** JWT authentication properly enforced in production
**So that** unauthorized users cannot access protected endpoints

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] JWT bypass security vulnerability removed
- [x] Production enforces real JWT validation
- [x] Development bypass available with explicit flag (USE_MOCK_AUTH=true)
- [x] Security logging added for authentication bypasses

**Result:** Critical security vulnerability eliminated, proper JWT authentication enforced

**CURSOR PROMPTS:**
```
Prompt 1:
"Remove the security vulnerability in backend/src/index.ts line 55 where JWT authentication is bypassed. Enable the proper JWT middleware that uses Azure AD B2C validation. The bypass line 'const checkJwt = (req: any, res: any, next: any) => next();' should be deleted and the commented-out proper JWT middleware should be uncommented and used instead."

Prompt 2:
"Ensure that the JWT middleware properly validates tokens from Azure AD B2C using the jwks-rsa library. The middleware should check the AZURE_AUTHORITY and AZURE_CLIENT_ID environment variables. Add proper error handling for invalid tokens."

Prompt 3:
"Add a conditional check so that JWT authentication can be bypassed only in development mode when USE_MOCK_AUTH environment variable is set to true, but always enforced in production."
```

**Files to Modify:**
- backend/src/index.ts (lines 55-56)
- backend/.env.template (add USE_MOCK_AUTH variable)

================================================================================

### USER STORY #3: Remove Duplicate Backend Code ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority:** CRITICAL (High Impact, Low Effort)
**Estimate:** 1 Story Point (10 minutes)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - temp_backend directory removed

**As a** developer
**I want** duplicate backend codebases removed
**So that** there's no confusion about which codebase is authoritative

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] temp_backend directory completely removed
- [x] Main backend confirmed as authoritative
- [x] No configuration references to temp_backend
- [x] Git history preserved for accountability

**Result:** Successfully removed duplicate backend code, eliminated confusion

**CURSOR PROMPTS:**
```
Prompt 1:
"Analyze the temp_backend directory and compare it with the main backend directory. Identify any unique functionality in temp_backend that doesn't exist in backend. If temp_backend is truly redundant, prepare it for removal."

Prompt 2:
"Remove the temp_backend directory entirely from the repository. Update any documentation files that reference temp_backend. Ensure no build scripts, Docker files, or configuration files reference the temp_backend path."

Prompt 3:
"Search through all configuration files (docker-compose.yml, package.json, README files) and remove any references to temp_backend. Update paths to point to the main backend directory only."
```

**Commands to Execute:**
```bash
# After Cursor analysis confirms temp_backend is duplicate
rm -rf temp_backend/
git add .
git commit -m "remove: duplicate temp_backend directory"
```

================================================================================

### USER STORY #4: Fix TypeScript Strict Mode Violations ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority:** HIGH (High Impact, Medium Effort)
**Estimate:** 5 Story Points (1 hour)

- [x] Central type export system (types/index.ts)
- [x] Major 'any' types replaced with proper interfaces
- [x] Type safety violations reduced significantly
- [x] No critical type safety issues blocking deployment

**Result:** Created comprehensive TypeScript type system, significantly improved type safety

**CURSOR PROMPTS:**
```
Prompt 1:
"Create proper TypeScript interfaces for all API responses in frontend/src/services/apiService.ts. Replace all 'any' types with specific interfaces like ApiResponse<T>, UploadResponse, FileResponse, etc. Use generic types where the response structure varies."

Prompt 2:
"In frontend/src/services/apiService.ts, replace the generic apiRequest function signature to use proper TypeScript generics. Change 'function apiRequest(url: string, method = 'GET', data?: any, auth = false): Promise<any>' to use proper generic types like 'function apiRequest<T>(url: string, method = 'GET', data?: unknown, auth = false): Promise<T>'"

Prompt 3:
"Fix TypeScript strict mode violations in authentication-related files (AuthContext.tsx, authService.ts, etc.). Create proper interfaces for user objects, authentication responses, and error objects. Replace 'any' with specific types or 'unknown' where the type is genuinely unknown."

Prompt 4:
"Create a types directory with shared interfaces for common data structures like User, Task, Fitness records, etc. Export these interfaces and use them consistently across all service files to replace 'any' types."
```

**Files to Create:**
- frontend/src/types/api.ts
- frontend/src/types/user.ts
- frontend/src/types/common.ts

Prompt 2:
"Create a comprehensive environment setup guide in ENV_SETUP.md that explains how to configure the application for different environments (development, staging, production). Include Azure service setup instructions and security best practices."

Prompt 3:
"Update the backend/scripts/create-env.js script to handle production environment setup. Add validation to check that production environment variables are not using placeholder values when NODE_ENV=production."

Prompt 4:
"Create environment variable validation in the backend startup process. The application should fail fast with clear error messages if required environment variables are missing or using placeholder values in production."
```

**Files to Create:**

## CURSOR WORKFLOW EXAMPLE

To implement User Story #1 (Fix Critical Linting Errors):

1. **Select all files in frontend/src**
2. **Use Cursor Chat with prompt:**
   "Fix all ESLint and Prettier formatting errors in the selected frontend files. Run the automated linting fix and then manually resolve any remaining TypeScript strict mode violations. Ensure all imports use single quotes consistently and proper spacing. Do not change any business logic - only fix formatting and style issues."

3. **After AI makes changes, run verification:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   ```

4. **If issues remain, follow up with:**
   "There are still [number] linting errors remaining. Please fix the remaining @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any errors and unused variable warnings shown in the terminal output."

5. **Commit when all checks pass:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: resolve 1,483 linting errors and format issues"
   ```
